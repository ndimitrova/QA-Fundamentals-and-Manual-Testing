Movie Catalog
Part I – Movie Catalog Web Application
It is provided a web application, Movie Catalog, along with a specification of the requirements. The primary objective of me is to ensure the App works as expected according to the provided use cases. This involves creating test cases for each of the USE CASES. It also includes the detection and detailed documentation of any identified bugs.
Part II – Movie Catalog API
My task was to write API requests with Postman for certain RESTful API endpoints.
1. Log in to the API; 2. Add a new movie; 3. List all movies; 4. Change the title of the movie you added; 5. Delete Revue
